<div class="entrygroup" id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3534817490044613273.post-1079302088510427146">
<h4><a href="http://extendingmatroidfunctionality.blogspot.com/2016/08/overview-of-what-was-done.html">Overview of what was done</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
My project has been extending the functionality of SageMath in a matroid direction.<br />As part of my application, and before the summer officially started, I worked on two tickets:&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20290">https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20290</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14666">https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14666</a>. The first was fixing a typo (and learning how to use the interface), and the second one modified the code to find a maximum weighted basis of a matroid so that a user could also see if there was exactly one maximum weighted basis. These are both currently incorporated into&nbsp;<span>official release version of SageMath</span>.<br /><br />At the beginning of the summer, I was focused on adding certificates to the pre written algorithms&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20660">is_isomorphic()</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20696">chordal functions</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20689">has_minor()</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20778">has_line_minor()</a>.&nbsp;All of these are closed tickets except the last one, which had a merge conflict. This also enabled me to get a feel for the documentation culture of my organization.<br /><br />The bulk of my project has been working on implementing <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3689867?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target=""><i>An Almost Linear-Time Algorithm</i></a> for Graph Realization by Robert Bixby and Donald Wagner. This algorithm was written with data structures that didn't exactly match the code base that I was incorporating the function into, so some changes were made there, and some simple (but not necessarily easy) supporting functions were added. There are still some bugs in the code, whose current version can be found <a href="https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20834">here</a>. Much of the rest of this post will be devoted to explaining the data structures that we used for the algorithm. It is aimed mostly at whoever (hopefully future me) is going to finish this function.<br /><br />We used two new data structures Node, and Decomposition. The decomposition is composed of nodes and relations between them. In particular, it contains a directed tree, where each vertex corresponds to a node. A decomposition also stores information which is useful to the functions that need it. The root of the tree is stored, as are the nodes which contain the first and last verticies of the hypopath along with these verticies. Also stored are integers to makes sure that we don't double name two verticies or two edges the same thing.<br /><br />A node contains a graph, a parent marker edge, and a parent marker vertex. The latter is one of the&nbsp;<span>vertices</span>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the parent marker edge, and is manipulated so that it is the edge which will end up being included in the path that comes from the hypopath. It also stores an integer T, which depends on the iteration of adding edges, and is stored after being computed.<br /><br />The flow structure of the main functions is given below. Each function is a decomposition function.<br /><div class="separator"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5xvyY925m5Q/V7sIsmAheUI/AAAAAAAABG0/O0RUUuz6o-A4POAGtIuIyD9DXH4iT5e0QCLcB/s1600/Diagram.png"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5xvyY925m5Q/V7sIsmAheUI/AAAAAAAABG0/O0RUUuz6o-A4POAGtIuIyD9DXH4iT5e0QCLcB/s320/Diagram.png" width="280" /></a></div><br /><br /><div>Here is the list of all the functions and the status of each of them.

Over the summer I have been coding for SAGE as part of Google Summer of Code 2016.  I feel this opportunity has strengthened both my skills as a coder and as a mathematician. SAGE is an open source math software system, used to do calculations.  SAGE is made up of code available for free public use and modification. It is a collaborative effort where people from around the world can add new code, update old code, and share the changes that they make. Open source coding is a labor of</div>

<h4><a href="http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2016/07/jupyter-take-domain-name-down.html">Jupyter: "take the domain name down immediately"</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
The <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a> is an open source BSD-licensed browser-based code execution environment, inspired by my early work on the Sage Notebook (which we launched in 2007), which was in turn inspired heavily by Mathematica notebooks and Google docs. Jupyter used to be called <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=jupyter%2C%20ipython&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B7">IPython</a>.<br /><br /><a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> is an open source web-based environment for using Sage worksheets, terminals, LaTeX documents, course management, and Jupyter notebooks. I've put much hard work into making it so that multiple people can simultaneously edit Jupyter notebooks in SageMathCloud, and the history of all changes are recorded and browsable via a slider.<br /><br />Many people have written to me asking for there to be a modified version of <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a>, which is oriented around Jupyter notebooks instead of Sage worksheets. So the default file type is Jupyter notebooks, the default kernel doesn't involve the extra heft of Sage, etc., and the domain name involves Jupyter instead of "sagemath". Some people are disuased from using SageMathCloud for Jupyter notebooks because of the "SageMath" name.<br /><br />Dozens of web applications (including SageMathCloud) use the word "Jupyter" in various places. However, I was unsure about using "jupyter" in a domain name. I found <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/governance/issues/12">this github issue</a> and requested clarification 6 weeks ago. We've had some back and forth, but they recently made it clear that it would be at least a month until any decision would be considered, since they are too busy with other things. In the meantime, I rented jupytercloud.com, which has a nice ring to it, as the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jupiter+cloud&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS691US691&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-vJubvJLOAhVEwYMKHRLlCCgQsAQIKg&biw=1147&bih=643">planet Jupiter has clouds.</a> Yesterday, I made jupytercloud.com point to cloud.sagemath.com to see what it would "feel like" and Tim Clemans started experimenting with customizing the page based on the domain name that the client sees. I did not mention jupytercloud.com publicly anywhere, and there were no links to it.<br /><br />Today I received this message:<br /><br /><pre><code>    William,<br /><br />    I'm writing this representing the Jupyter project leadership<br />    and steering council. It has recently come to the Jupyter<br />    Steering Council's attention that the domain jupytercloud.com<br />    points to SageMathCloud. Do you own that domain? If so,<br />    we ask that you take the domain name down immediately, as<br />    it uses the Jupyter name.</code></pre><pre></pre>I of course immediately complied. It is well within their rights to dictate how their name is used, and I am obsessive about scrupulously doing everything I can to respect people's intellectual property; with Sage we have put huge amounts of effort into honoring both the letter and spirit of copyright statements on open source software.<br /><br />I'm writing this because it's unclear to me what people really want, and I have no idea what to do here.<br /><br />1. Do <strong>you</strong> want something built on the same technology as SageMathCloud, but much more focused on Jupyter notebooks?<br /><br />2. Does the name of the site matter to <strong>you</strong>?<br /><br />3. What model should the Jupyter project use for their trademark? Something like Python? like Git?Like Linux? &nbsp;Like Firefox? &nbsp;Like the email program PINE? &nbsp;Something else entirely?<br /><br />4. Should I be worried about using Jupyter at all anywhere? E.g., in this blog post? As the default notebook for the SageMath project?<br /><br />I appreciate any feedback.<br /><br /><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12169979" target="_blank">Hacker News Discussion</a><br /><br /><b>UPDATE (Aug 12, 2016): </b>The official decision is that I <b>cannot</b>&nbsp;use the domain jupytercloud.com. &nbsp; They did say I can use <b>jupyter.sagemath.com </b>or <b>sagemath.com/jupyter</b>. &nbsp; Needless to say, I'm disappointed, but I fully respect their (very foolish, IMHO) decision.<br /><br /><br /></div>

In the 1960’s French writer and poet Raymond Queneau became the most prolific writers of our time by writing over one hundred thousand billion poems.  If you wanted to read all of these poems it would only take you 200 million years of reading 24 hours a day at a rate of about one poem per minute.

 So how could Queneau write so many poems in far less time than it would take to read them all?

The truth is he didn’t actually write that many individual poems. What he did was write ten 14-line</div>

<h4><a href="http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2016/07/datadogs-pricing-dont-make-same-mistake.html">DataDog's pricing: don't make the same mistake I made</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
I stupidly made a mistake recently by choosing to use <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">DataDog</a> for monitoring the infrastructure for my startup (<a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a>).<br /><br />I got bit by their pricing UI design that looks similar to many other sites, but is different in a way that caused me to <strong>spend far more money than I expected.</strong><br /><br />I'm writing this post so that you won't make the same mistake I did. &nbsp;As a product, DataDog is of course a lot of hard work to create, and they can try to charge whatever they want. However, my problem is that <strong>what</strong> they are going to charge was confusing and misleading to me.<br /><br />I wanted to see some nice web-based data about my new autoscaled Kubernetes cluster, so I looked around at options. DataDog looked like a new and awesomely-priced service for seeing live logging. And when I looked (not carefully enough) at the pricing, it looked like only $15/month to monitor a bunch of machines. I'm naive about the cost of cloud monitoring -- I've been using Stackdriver on Google cloud platform for years, which is completely free (for now, though that will change), and I've also used self hosted open solutions, and some quite nice solutions I've written myself. So my expectations were way out of whack.<br /><br />Ever busy, I signed up for the "$15/month plan":<br /><div class="separator"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NK09JkZDOD0/V5Jyf6jYy2I/AAAAAAABYNA/l_LP-NJv6hgODAvvaO868frbtJ4hP9SUQCLcB/s1600/dd-pricing.png"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NK09JkZDOD0/V5Jyf6jYy2I/AAAAAAABYNA/l_LP-NJv6hgODAvvaO868frbtJ4hP9SUQCLcB/s400/dd-pricing.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />One of the people on my team spent a little time and installed datadog on all the VM's in our cluster, and also made DataDog automatically start running on any nodes in our Kubernetes cluster. That's a lot of machines.<br /><br />Today I got the first monthly bill, which is for the month that just happened. The cost was $639.19 USD charged to my credit card. I was really confused for a while, wondering if I had bought a year subscription.<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LK7iRxeqMKI/V5JymhrBN-I/AAAAAAABYNE/lCA0YC3cfSMJ9LuTsFgsrt8vTUR4rvRIQCLcB/s1600/dd-invoice.png"><img border="0" height="198" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LK7iRxeqMKI/V5JymhrBN-I/AAAAAAABYNE/lCA0YC3cfSMJ9LuTsFgsrt8vTUR4rvRIQCLcB/s400/dd-invoice.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />After a while I realized that the cost is per host! When I looked at the pricing page the first time, I had just saw in big letters "$15", and "$18 month-to-month" and "up to 500 hosts". I completely missed the "Per Host" line, because I was so naive that I didn't think the price could possibly be that high.<br /><br />I tried immediately to delete my credit card and cancel my plan, but the "Remove Card" button is greyed out, and it says you can "modify your subscription by contacting us at success@datadoghq.com":<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iohuYjKf3_A/V5JzPDN7qHI/AAAAAAABYNM/QBn6pqJ_OL0roteJIyxHWx5wajJRs4_EwCLcB/s1600/dd-cancel.png"><img border="0" height="318" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iohuYjKf3_A/V5JzPDN7qHI/AAAAAAABYNM/QBn6pqJ_OL0roteJIyxHWx5wajJRs4_EwCLcB/s400/dd-cancel.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />So I wrote to success@datadoghq.com:<br /><br /><pre><code>Dear Datadog,<br /><br />Everybody on my team was completely mislead by your<br />horrible pricing description.<br /><br />Please cancel the subscription for wstein immediately<br />and remove my credit card from your system.<br /><br />This is the first time I've wasted this much money<br />by being misled by a website in my life.<br /><br />I'm also very unhappy that I can't delete my credit<br />card or cancel my subscription via your website.  It's<br />like one more stripe API call to remove the credit card<br />(I know -- I implemented this same feature for my site).</code></pre><pre><code><br /></code></pre><hr />And they responded:<br /><br /><pre><code>Thanks for reaching out. If you'd like to cancel your<br />Datadog subscription, you're able to do so by going into<br />the platform under 'Plan and Usage' and choose the option<br />downgrade to 'Lite', that will insure your credit card<br />will not be charged in the future. Please be sure to<br />reduce your host count down to the (5) allowed under<br />the 'Lite' plan - those are the maximum allowed for<br />the free plan.<br /><br />Also, please note you'll be charged for the hosts<br />monitored through this month. Please take a look at<br />our billing FAQ.</code></pre><hr /><br />They were right -- I was able to uninstall the daemons, downgrade to Lite, remove my card, etc. all through the website without manual intervention.<br /><br />When people have been confused with billing for <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">my site</a>, I have apologized, immediately refunded their money, and opened a ticket to make the UI clearer. &nbsp;DataDog didn't do any of that.<br /><br />I wish DataDog would at least clearly state that when you use their service you are potentially on the hook for an <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> charge for any month. Yes, if they had made that clear, they wouldn't have had me as a customer, so they are not incentivized to do so.<br /><br />A fool and their money are soon parted. I hope this post reduces the chances you'll be a fool like me. &nbsp;If you chose to use DataDog, and their monitoring tools are very impressive, I hope you'll be aware of the cost.  <br /><br /><br />ADDED:<br /><br />On <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=williamstein" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> somebody asked: "<span>How could their pricing page be clearer? It says per host in fairly large letters underneath it.&nbsp;</span><span>I'm asking because I will be designing a similar page soon (that's also billed per host) and I'd like to avoid the same mistakes." &nbsp;My answer:</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>[EDIT: This pricing page by the top poster in this thread is way better than I suggest below -- https://www.serverdensity.com/pricing/]</span><br /><span><br /></span><span>1.&nbsp;</span><i></i><span>VERY clearly</span><i></i><span>&nbsp;state that when you sign up for the service, then you are on the hook for up to $18*500 = $9000 + tax in charges for any month. Even Google compute engine (and Amazon) don't create such a trap, and have a clear explicit quota increase process.</span><br /><div>2. Instead of "HUGE $15" newline "(small light) per host", put "HUGE $18 per host" all on the same line. It would easily fit. I don't even know how the $15/host datadog discount could ever really work, given that the number of hosts might constantly change and there is no prepayment.</div><div>3. Inform users clearly in the UI at any time how much they are going to owe for that month (so far), rather than surprising them at the end. Again, Google Cloud Platform has a very clear running total in their billing section, and any time you create a new VM it gives the exact amount that VM will cost per month.</div><div>4. If one works with a team, 3 is especially important. The reason that I had monitors on 50+ machines is that another person working on the project, who never looked at pricing or anything, just thought -- he I'll just set this up everywhere. He had no idea there was a per-machine fee.</div><span class="comment"><span class="c00"></span></span><br /><div class="reply"><div><span class="comment"><span class="c00"><span><u><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=12146416&goto=item%3Fid%3D12145879%2312146416">reply</a></u></span></span></span></div></div><span class="comment"><span class="c00"></span></span></div>

My summer of code is broken up into several projects. There were a lot of small ones, a couple medium ones, and one large one. Right now, I'm in the midst of working on the large project. Basically, we want to feed Sage a collection of subsets of an edge set E, and have Sage tell us if there is a graph that has cycles which correspond to the subsets of E, and if so, to give a corresponding. This boils down to asking if a matroid is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_matroid" target="_blank">graphic</a>, and asking for a graph that realizes the matroid.<br /><br />For instance, if we give have E = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and our collection of sets is any three element subset of E, then we can't get an appropriate graph. To see this, we start constructing a graph. Our first cycle is {1, 2, 3}, There is only one graph on three elements that has this cycle, namely a triangle. To add the edge 4, we need to have a cycle {1, 2, 4}. But this means that we have to add 4 in parallel to the edge 3. This is a problem, because then {1, 3, 4}, in particular, is not a cycle of our graph.<br /><br />This example illustrates a key idea of the algorithm. The set {1, 2} is a maximal set that is not contained in a cylce, so we skipped over those elements, and started with 3. We then added 3 and any needed elements of {1, 2} to our partial graph. And we kept adding elements till we either had a problem, or till we added all of the elements.<br /><br />In our case, we didn't get so complicated of a graph that we had a choice about which graph to use for our partial graph. In general, this is not the case. It would be troublesome to check if we could add the new element to every graphs that realizes the already added elements, so we use a decomposition made possible by <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgt.3190040106/pdf" target="_blank">Whitney's 2 isomorphism theorem</a> to check all of the graphs options at once. This of course makes the code more complicated. The algorithm that we are following comes from a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3689867?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">paper</a> by Ronald Bixby and Donald Wagner.<br /><br />The tricky part, so far, has been trying to get information in and out of graphs. graph theorists care a lot about the vertices of a graph and much less about the edges of the graph. That is, they store their edges as a list of the two vertices that they are incident with, and a possible label. matroid theorists, however, care a lot more about the edges of a graph. This is true in general, and is true in particular for this project.</div>

Two weeks into GSOC 2016 I’m so grateful that this is how I get to spend my summer. Using my coding muscles has made me stronger and more confident with my code.
I am ready to create my first ticket in SAGE relating to GSOC. Sage uses Trac, which is an open source project managing software. It allows SAGE to track what people are currently working on for SAGE. It does this by are giving a ticket number to each piece of functionality pushed to the server.

I first heard about Google Summer of Code a little over a year ago. It was something that I wanted to do for several reasons. I only had a chance to take a couple of programing classes in undergrad. (I didn't realized that I liked it till part way through my Junior year.) Since then, I've wanted to grow the length and complexity of projects that I was capable of successfully working on. Secondly, I like the idea of open source resources, because its free, and that lets poor college students use cool resources.<br /><br />My project is building and expanding tools in <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> to be used by people studying matroid theory. A <a href="https://www.math.lsu.edu/~oxley/survey4.pdf">matroid</a> is a notion of independence that generalizes the independence structure that is found in vector spaces and that comes from looking at cycleless subgraphs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graphs</a>. Sage already has a lot of <a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matroids/index.html">tools</a> that let people work with matroids, mostly created by Stefan van Zwam and Rudi Pendavingh. My <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4830375092158464">project</a> focuses on a small collection of new tools.<br /><br />I'll be working with Stefan and Michael on this project.</div>

<div class="content">
<br /><br /><span><span>When I think about what makes SageMath different, one of the most fundamental things is that it was created by people who use it every day. &nbsp;It was created by people doing research math, by people teaching math at universities, and by computer programmers and engineers using it for research. &nbsp;It was created by people who really understand computational problems because we live them. &nbsp;We understand the needs of math research, teaching courses, and managing an open source project that users can contribute to and customize to work for their own unique needs.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>The tools we were using, like Mathematica, are clunky, very expensive, and just don't do everything we need. &nbsp;And worst of all, they are closed source software, meaning that you can't even see how they work, and can't modify them to do what you really need. &nbsp;For teaching math, professors get bogged down scheduling computer labs and arranging for their students to buy and install expensive software.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>So I started SageMath as an open source project at Harvard in 2004, to solve the problem that other math software is expensive, closed source, and limited in functionality, and to create a powerful tool for the students in my classes. &nbsp;It wasn't a project that was intended initially as something to be used by hundred of thousands of people. &nbsp;But as I got into the project and as more professors and students started contributing to the project, I could clearly see that these weren't just problems that pissed me off, they were problems that made everyone angry.</span></span><br /><span><span><br /></span></span><span><span>The scope of SageMath rapidly expanded. &nbsp;Our mission evolved to create a free open source serious competitor to Mathematica and similar closed software that the mathematics community was collective spending hundreds of millions of dollars on every year.

<div class="entrygroup" id="http://sheaves.github.io/Noncommutative-Sage/">
<h4><a href="http://sheaves.github.io/Noncommutative-Sage/">Noncommutative Algebras in Sage</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In this post, I’ll demonstrate 3 ways to define non-commutative rings in Sage. They’re essentially different ways of expressing the non-commutative relations in the ring:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/free_algebra.html#sage.algebras.free_algebra.FreeAlgebra_generic.g_algebra" target="_blank">Via <code class="highlighter-rouge">g_algebra</code></a>: define the relations directly</li>

  <li><a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/quotient_ring.html" target="_blank">Via a quotient of a letterplace ring</a>: define the ideal generated by the relations (only works for homogeneous relations)</li>
</ol>

<!--more-->

<p>As far as I know, all 3 methods rely on Sage’s interface with <a href="https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php" target="_blank">Singular</a> and its non-commutative extension <a href="https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_469.htm" target="_blank">Plural</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to all the documentation linked above, I also relied heavily on  Greuel and Pfister’s <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/archivesecoles/20130130100834/singularbuch1-210.pdf" target="_blank"><em>A Singular Introduction to
Commutative Algebra</em></a>. Despite the title, it does have a pretty substantial section (1.9) devoted to non-commutative $G$-algebras.</p>

<h2 id="umathfraksl2-and-its-homogenization">$U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and its homogenization</h2>

<p>The running example throughout this post will be the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.</p>

<p>We’ll define this to be the (non-commutative) $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $U$ with generators $e,f,h$ subject to the relations</p>



<p>If we set $e,f,h$ to have degree 1, these relations are not homogeneous. Their left-hand sides only have degree 2 terms, while their right-hand sides have degree 1 terms as well. This is fine with the first two methods, but won’t work for method 3 (which requires homogeneous relations).</p>

<p>To demonstrate the third method, we’ll define the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $H$ with generators $e,f,h,t$ subject to the homogeneous relations</p>





<p>We can obtain $U$ both as a quotient and a localization of $H$:</p>



<h2 id="g-algebras">$G$-algebras</h2>
<p>Using the  <a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/free_algebra.html#sage.algebras.free_algebra.FreeAlgebra_generic.g_algebra" target="_blank"><code class="highlighter-rouge">g_algebra</code></a> method of Sage’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">FreeAlgebra</code> class, we can simply plug our noncommutative relations in, and get our non-commutative ring. This is about as easy as it gets:</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>Let’s unravel what’s going on here.</p>

<h3 id="monomial-orderings-and-pbw-basis">Monomial orderings and PBW basis</h3>
<p>Most algorithms for commutative and non-commutative rings require an ordering on the generators. In our case, let’s use the ordering</p>



<p>This is implicitly stated in our code: we wrote <code class="highlighter-rouge">F.&lt;e,f,h&gt;</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">F.&lt;h,e,f&gt;</code>, for example.</p>

<p>A <em>standard word</em> is a monomial of the form</p>



<p>In the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}[e,f,h]$, every monomial can be expressed in this form, so the set of standard words forms a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $\mathbb{Q}[e,f,h]$.</p>

<p>In a non-commutative ring, whether or not the standard words form a basis depends on what relations we have. Such a basis, if it exists, is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Birkhoff%E2%80%93Witt_theorem" target="_blank">PBW basis</a>.</p>

<p>The free algebra $F = \mathbb{Q}\langle e,f,h\rangle$ has no relations, so does not have a PBW basis. Fortunately, our algebra $U$ does have a PBW basis.</p>

<p>This means that we can always express a non-standard monomial (e.g. $fe$) as a sum of standard monomials (e.g. $ef - h$). The non-commutative relations that define $U$ can thus be thought of as an algorithm for turning non-standard words into sums of standard words.</p>

<p>To do this in Sage, we define a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" target="_blank">dictionary</a> whose keys are non-standard words and values are the standard words they become.</p>

<p>In the above example, our dictionary was short enough to fit into one line, but we could also define a dictionary separately and pass it into <code class="highlighter-rouge">g_algebra</code>:</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>It’s very important that the keys are non-standard words and the values are sums of standard words. Mathematically, the relation $fe = ef - h$ is the same as $ef = fe + h$, but if we replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">f*e : e*f - h</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">e*f : f*e + h</code> in the code, we’ll get an error (try it!).</p>

<h3 id="what-are-g-algebras">What are $G$-algebras?</h3>
<p>The reason why $U$ has a PBW basis is because it is a $G$-algebra. Briefly, $G$-algebras are algebras whose relations satisfy certain non-degeneracy conditions that make the algebra nice to work with.</p>

<p>For a full definition of $G$-algebras, refer to <a href="http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/archivesecoles/20130130100834/singularbuch1-210.pdf" target="_blank"><em>A Singular Introduction to Commutative Algebra</em></a> or the <a href="https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_534.htm#SEC573" target="_blank">Plural manual</a>.</p>

<p>If $A$ is a $G$-algebra, then it has a PBW basis, is left and right Noetherian, and is an integral domain. More importantly (for this site at least!), it means that we can define $A$ in Singular/Plural, and hence in Sage.</p>

<h2 id="structural-matrices-for-a-g-algebra">Structural matrices for a $G$-algebra</h2>
<p>Another way of writing our non-commutative relations is</p>



<p>where $ * $ denotes element-wise multiplication (so there isn’t any linear algebra going on here; we’re just using matrices to organize the information). Let $N,C,S,D$ be the matrices above, in that order, so that $N = C*S + D$.</p>

<p>If we let $x_1 = e, x_2 = f, x_3 = h$ (so that $x_i \leq x_j$ if $i \leq j$) then for $i &lt; j$</p>



<p>In other words, $N$ contains the non-standard words that we’re trying to express in terms of the standard words in $S$.</p>

<p>The matrices $C$ and $D$ are called the <em>structural matrices</em> of the $G$-algebra, and their entries are such that our relations may be written</p>



<p>with zeros everywhere else ($i \geq j$). If $C = D = 0$, the resulting algebra will be commutative.</p>

<p>We can use the structural matrices $C$ and $D$ to define our algebra via Sage’s  <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.html" target="_blank"><code class="highlighter-rouge">NCPolynomialRing_plural</code></a> function (note that Python uses zero-indexing for matrices):</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>Note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> is a commutative polynomial ring. In fact, up till the point where we call <code class="highlighter-rouge">NCPolynomialRing_plural</code>, even the variables <code class="highlighter-rouge">e,f,h</code> are treated as commutative variables.</p>

<p>This method of defining $U$ is considerably longer and more prone to mistakes than using <code class="highlighter-rouge">g_algebra</code>. As stated in the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>, this is not intended for use! I’m including it here because this is essentially how one would go about defining a $G$-algebra in Singular. In fact, the Sage method <code class="highlighter-rouge">g_algebra</code> calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">NCPolynomialRing_plural</code>, which in turn calls Singular.</p>

<h2 id="quotients-of-letterplace-rings">Quotients of letterplace rings</h2>
<p>Our final method for defining non-commutative rings makes use of <a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/letterplace/free_algebra_letterplace.html" target="_blank">Sage’s implementation of Singular’s letterplace rings</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned at the start of this post, this method requires the relations to be homogeneous, so we’ll work with $H$ instead of $U$.</p>

<p>Let $\mathbb{Q}\langle e,f,h,t \rangle$ be the free algebra on 4 variables. Consider the two-sided ideal $I$ generated by the relations for $H$:</p>



<p>Then</p>



<p>This can be expressed Sage-ly:</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>The expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">F*I*F</code> is the two-sided ideal generated by elements in the list <code class="highlighter-rouge">I</code>.</p>

<p>Although $U$ cannot be defined using this method, $H$ can be defined using all three methods. As a (fun?) exercise, try defining $H$ using the other two methods.</p>

<h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>
<p>These methods can be used to define many non-commutative algebras such as the Weyl algebra and various enveloping algebras of Lie algebras. One can also define these algebras over fields other than $\mathbb{Q}$, such as $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$.</p>

<p>However, we cannot define algebras over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$, the fraction field of $\mathbb{Q}[q]$:</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>This is a problem if we want to define rings with relations such as</p>



<p>Such relations occur frequently when studying quantum groups, for example.</p>

<p>This is suprising, because one can easily define $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ and non-commutative $\mathbb{Q}(q)$-algebras in Singular/Plural, which is what Sage is using. It seems that the problem is in Sage’s wrapper for Singular/Plural, because Sage can’t even pass the ring $\mathbb{Q}(q)$ to Singular.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14886" target="_blank">trac ticket</a> for this problem, but until it gets resolved, we’ll just have to define such rings directly in Singular/Plural. Thanks to the amazing capabilities of the <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/" target="_blank">Sage Cell Server</a>, we’ll do this in the next post!</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2016/02/if-you-were-new-faculty-member-again.html">"If you were new faculty, would you start something like SageMathCloud sooner?"</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
I was recently asked by a young academic: "If you were a new faculty member again, would you start something like SageMathCloud sooner or simply leave for industry?"  The academic goes on to say "I am increasingly frustrated by continual evidence that it is more valuable to publish a litany of computational papers with no source code than to do the thankless task of developing a niche open source library; deep mathematical software is not appreciated by either mathematicians or the public."<br /><br />I wanted to answer that "things have gotten better" since back in 2000 when I started as an academic who does computation.  Unfortunately, I think they have gotten worse.  I do not understand why.   In fact, this evening I just received the most recent in a <a href="http://wstein.org/grants/" target="_blank">long string of rejections by the NSF</a>.  <br /><br />Regarding a company versus taking a job in industry, for me personally there is no point in starting a company unless you have a goal that can only be accomplished via a company, since building a business from scratch is extremely hard and has little to do with math or research.  I do have such a goal: "create a viable open source alternative to Mathematica, etc...".   I was very clearly told by Michael Monagan (co-founder of Maplesoft) in 2006 that this goal could not be accomplished in academia, and I spent the last 10 years trying to prove him wrong.  <br /><br />On the other hand, leaving for a job in industry means that your focus will switch from "pure" research to solving concrete problems that make products better for customers.  That said, many of the mathematicians who work on open source math software do so because they care so much about making the experience of using math software much better for the math community.  What often drives Sage developers is exactly the sort of passionate care for "consumer focus" and products that also makes one successful in industry.  I'm sure you know exactly what I mean, since it probably partly motivates your work.  It is sad that the math community turns its back on such people.   If the community were to systematically embrace them, instead of losing all these $300K+/year engineers to mathematics entirely -- which is exactly what we do constantly -- the experience of doing mathematics could be massively improved into the future.  But that is not what the community has chosen to do.  We are shooting ourselves in the foot.  <br /><br />Now that I have seen how academia works from the inside over 15 years I'm starting to understand a little why these things change very slowly, if ever.  In the mathematics department I'm at, there are a small handful of research areas in pure math, and due to how hiring works (voting system, culture, etc.) we have spent the last 10 years hiring in those areas little by little (to replace people who die/retire/leave).   I imagine most mathematics departments are very similar.   "Open source software" is not one of those traditional areas.   Nobody will win a Fields Medal in it.  <br /><br />Overall, the mathematical community does not value open source mathematical software in proportion to its value, and doesn't understand its importance to mathematical research and education.  I would like to say that things have got a lot better over the last decade, but I don't think they have. My personal experience is that much of the "next generation" of mathematicians who would have changed how the math community approaches open source software are now in industry, or soon will be, and hence they have no impact on academic mathematical culture.   Every one of my Ph.D. students are now at Google/Facebook/etc.  <br /><br />We as a community overall would be better off if, when considering how we build departments, we put "mathematical software writers" on an equal footing with "algebraic geometers".   We should systematically consider quality open source software contributions on a potentially equal footing with publications in journals.  <br /><br />To answer the original question, <b>YES</b>, knowing what I know now, I really wish I had started something like SageMathCloud sooner. In fact, here's the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-dotcom" target="_blank">previously private discussion</a> from eight years ago when I almost did.   <br /><br />--<br /><br />- There is a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxEE5GjSeA07xJy_SUDy-rDia8tzFPGS6kMIkMPHh8E/edit" target="_blank">community generated followup ...</a><br /><div>- Relevant blog post:&nbsp;<a href="http://martin.softf1.com/g/yellow_soap_opera_blog/about-software-development-in-companies-communities-and-the-academia" target="_blank">About Software Development in Companies, Communities and the Academia</a></div></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<h3>Elliptic Curves</h3>Elliptic curves are certain types of nonsingular plane cubic curves, e.g., y^2 = x^3&nbsp;+ ax&nbsp;+b, which are central to both number theory and cryptography (e.g., they are used to compute the hash in bitcoin).<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qW1pKO63Xfs/Vs4NUYQVtbI/AAAAAAABXIE/Nw6-KGy31-0/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-02-24%2Bat%2B12.06.23%2BPM.png"><img border="0" height="227" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qW1pKO63Xfs/Vs4NUYQVtbI/AAAAAAABXIE/Nw6-KGy31-0/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-02-24%2Bat%2B12.06.23%2BPM.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Magma and Sage</h3>If you want to do a wide range of explicit computations with elliptic curves, for research purposes, you will very likely use&nbsp;<a href="http://sagemath.org/" target="_blank">SageMath&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/" target="_blank">Magma</a>. If you're&nbsp;<strong>really</strong>&nbsp;serious, you'll use both.<br /><br />Both Sage and Magma are far ahead of all other software (e.g., Mathematica, Maple and Matlab) for elliptic curves.<br /><ul><li><a href="https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/part/16">Magma reference manual about elliptic curves.</a></li><li><a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plane_curves/index.html#elliptic-curves">Sage reference manual about elliptic curves.</a></li><li><a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html.stable/Functions_related_to_elliptic_curves.html">Pari reference manual about elliptic curves.</a> -- pari is part of Sage and has some unique powerful functionality, e.g., <code>ellheegner</code>...</li></ul><h3 id="history">A Little History</h3>When I started contributing to Magma in 1999, I remember that Magma was way, way behind Pari. I remember having lunch with John Cannon (founder of Magma), and telling him I would no longer have to use Pari if only Magma would have dramatically faster code for computing point counts on elliptic curves.<br /><br />A few years later, John wisely hired Mark Watkins to work fulltime on Magma, and Mark has been working there for over a decade. Mark is definitely one of the top people in the world at implementing (and using) computational number theory algorithms, and he's ensured that Magma can do a lot. Some of that "do a lot" means catching up with (and surpassing!) what was in Pari and Sage for a long time (e.g., point counting, <span class="math"><em>p</em></span>-adic <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>-functions, etc.)<br /><br />However, in addition, many people have visited Sydney and added extremely deep functionality for doing higher descents to Magma, which is <strong>not available in any open source software</strong>. Search for Magma in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01894">this paper</a> to see how, even today, there seems to be no open source way to compute the rank of the curve <span class="math"><em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 169304<em>x</em> + 25788938</span>. &nbsp;(The rank is 0.)<br /><h3 id="situation-today">Two Codebases</h3>There are several elliptic curves algorithms available <strong>only in Magma</strong> (e.g., higher descents) ... and some available <strong>only in Sage</strong> (<span class="math"><em>L</em></span>-function rank bounds, some overconvergent modular symbols, zeros of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span>-functions, images of Galois representations). I could be wrong about functionality not being in Magma, since almost anything can get implemented in a year...<br /><br />The code bases are almost completely separate, which is a very good thing. Any time something gets implemented in one, it gets (or should get) tested via a big run on elliptic curves up to some bound in the other. This sometimes results in bugs being found. I remember <a href="http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3674" target="_blank">refereeing the "integral points" code in Sage</a> by running it against all curves up to some bound and comparing to what Magma output, and getting many discrepancies, which showed that there were bugs in both Sage and Magma.<br />Thus we would be way better off if Sage could do everything Magma does (and vice versa).<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<p>Here is my answer. Indeed, in Sage, symbolic variables can't multiply with
elements in an Number Field in x:</p>

<p>But, we can define a polynomial ring with variables in a,b and coefficients in
the NumberField. Then, we are able to multiply <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">x</tt>:</p>

<p>With two square brackets, we obtain powers series:</p>

<h4><a href="http://sheaves.github.io/Weyl-Algebra/">The Weyl Algebra and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<!--more-->

<p>I’ve been away from this blog for quite a while - almost a year, in fact! My excuses are my wedding and the prelims (a.k.a. quals), as well as all the preparation that had to go into them (although, to be honest, those things only occupied me till September last year!).</p>

<p>Looking back at my previous posts, I’ve realized that in attempting to teach <em>both</em> math and code, I probably ended up doing neither. This is really not the best place to learn representation theory (for example) - there are better books and blogs out there. Also, most of the code that I wrote to illustrate those posts feels contrived, and neither highlights Sage’s strengths nor reflects how I normally use Sage for my assignments and projects.</p>

<p>I’ve thus decided to write shorter posts with code that I actually use (on <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/" target="_blank">SageMathCloud</a>), along with some explanations of the code. Lately, I’ve been writing code for non-commutative algebra and combinatorics, so today I’ll start with a simple example of a non-commutative algebra.</p>

<h2 id="the-weyl-algebra">The Weyl Algebra</h2>
<p>The $1$-dim. Weyl algebra is the (non-commutative) algebra generated by $x, \partial_x$ subject to the relations</p>



<p>If we treat $x$ as “multiplication by $x$” and $\partial_x$ as  “differentiation w.r.t. $x$”, this relation is really just an application of the chain rule:</p>



<p>We can generalize to higher dimensions: the $n$-dim. Weyl algebra is the algebra generated by  $x_1,\dots,x_n,\partial_{x_1},\dots,\partial_{x_n}$ quotiented by the relations that arise from treating them as the obvious operators on $\mathbb{F}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.</p>

<h3 id="weyl-algebras-in-sage">Weyl algebras in Sage</h3>
<p>It’s easy to <a href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/weyl_algebra.html" target="_blank">define the Weyl algebra in Sage</a>:</p>

<div class="linked">
  
</div>

<p>Calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">inject_variables</code> allows us to use the operators <code class="highlighter-rouge">x,y,z,dx,dy,dz</code> in subsequent code (where <code class="highlighter-rouge">dx</code> denotes $\partial_x$, etc).</p>

<p>One can do rather complicated computations:</p>

<div class="linked">
  
</div>

<p>By default, Sage chooses to represent monomials with <code class="highlighter-rouge">x,y,z</code> in front of <code class="highlighter-rouge">dx,dy,dz</code>:</p>

<div class="linked">
  
</div>

<p>Keep in mind that <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> does not refer to the polynomial $x \in \mathbb{F}[x]$, so one should not expect <code class="highlighter-rouge">dx*x</code> to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>.</p>

<p>(For some reason <code class="highlighter-rouge">show</code> does not give the right output. Try <code class="highlighter-rouge">show(x)</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">show(x*dx)</code>, for example.)</p>

<h2 id="representations-of-mathfraksl2">Representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$</h2>
<p>It turns out that the $1$-dim. Weyl algebra gives a representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F})$.</p>

<p>The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{F})$ is generated by $E,F,H$ subject to the relations</p>



<p>Define the following elements of the $1$-dim. Weyl algebra:</p>



<p>We can use Sage to quickly verify that these elements indeed satisfy the relations for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ (using the commutator as the Lie bracket i.e. $[A,B] = AB - BA$):</p>

<div class="sage">
  
</div>

<p>Working over $\mathbb{C}$, this action of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ makes $\mathbb{C}[x]$ a Verma module of highest weight $0$.</p>

<p>In fact, we can make $\mathbb{C}[x]$ a Verma module of highest weight $c$ for any $c \in \mathbb{C}$ by using:</p>



<p>We verify this again in Sage:</p>

<p>In subsequent posts, I’ll talk more about defining other non-commutative algebras in Sage and Singular.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
This is about my personal experience as a mathematics professor whose students all have non-academic jobs that they love.  This is in preparation for a panel at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in Seattle.<br /><span><br /></span><span>My students and industry</span><br /><div>My graduated Ph.D. students:</div><ul><li>3 at Google</li><li>1 at Facebook</li><li>1 at CCR</li></ul><div>My graduating student (Hao Chen):</div><ul><li>Applying for many postdocs</li><li>But just did summer internship at Microsoft Research with Kristin. (I’ve had four students do summer internships with Kristin)</li></ul><div>All my students:</div><ul><li>Have done a lot of Software development, maybe having little to do with math, e.g., “developing the Cython compiler”, “transition the entire Sage project to git”, etc.</li><li>Did a thesis squarely in number theory, with significant theoretical content.</li><li>Guilt (or guilty pleasure?) spending time on some programming tasks instead of doing what they are “supposed” to do as math grad students.</li></ul><h2 id="me-academia-and-industry">Me: academia and industry</h2><ul><li>Math Ph.D. from Berkeley in 2000; many students of my advisor (Lenstra) went to work at CCR after graduating…</li><li>Academia: I’m a tenured math professor (since 2005) – number theory.</li><li>Industry: I founded a Delaware C Corp (SageMath, Inc.) one year ago to “commercialize Sage” due to VERY intense frustration trying to get grant funding for Sage development. Things have got so bad, with so many painful stupid missed opportunities over so many years, that I’ve given up on academia as a place to build Sage.</li></ul><div><span>Reality check:</span>&nbsp;Academia values basic research, not products. Industry builds concrete&nbsp;<em>valuable</em>&nbsp;products. Not understanding this is a recipe for pain (at least it has been for me).</div><h2 id="advice-for-students-from-students">Advice for students from students</h2><h3 id="robert-miller-google-">Robert Miller (Google)</h3><div>My student Robert Miller’s post on Facebook yesterday: <b>“I LOVE MY JOB”</b>. Why: “Today I gave the first talk in a seminar I organized to discuss this result: ‘Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time’. Dozens of people showed up, it was awesome!”</div><div>Background: When he was my number theory student, working on elliptic curves, he gave a talk about graph theory in Sage at a Sage Days (at IPAM). His interest there was mainly in helping an undergrad (Emily Kirkman) with a Sage dev project I hired her to work on. David Harvey asked: “what’s so hard about implementing graph isomorphism”, and Robert wanted to find out, so he spent months doing a full implementation of Brendan McKay’s algorithm (the only other one). This had absolutely nothing to do with his Ph.D. thesis work on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, but I was very supportive.</div><h3 id="craig-citro-google-">Craig Citro (Google)</h3><div>Craig Citro did a Ph.D. in number theory (with Hida), but also worked on Sage a<em>LOT</em>&nbsp;as a grad student and postdoc. He’s done a lot of hiring at Google. He says: “My main piece of advice to potential google applicants is ‘start writing as much code as you can, right now.’ Find out whether you’d actually&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>working for a company like Google, where a large chunk of your job may be coding in front of a screen. I’ve had several friends from math discover (the hard way) that they don’t really enjoy full-time programming (any more than they enjoy full-time teaching?).”</div><div>“Start throwing things on github now. Potential interviewers are&nbsp;<em>going</em>&nbsp;to check out your github profile; having some cool stuff at the top is great, but seeing a regular stream of commits is also a useful signal.”<br /><h3 id="robert-bradshaw-google-">Robert Bradshaw (Google)</h3><div>“A lot of mathematicians are good at (and enjoy) programming. Many of them aren’t (and don’t). Find out. Being involved in Sage is significantly more than just having taken a suite of programming courses or hacking personal scripts on your own: code reviews, managing bugs, testing, large-scale design, working with others’ code, seeing projects through to completion, and collaborating with others, local and remote, on large, technical projects are all important. It demonstrates your passion.”</div></div><h3 id="rado-kirov-google-">Rado Kirov (Google)</h3><div>“<span>Robert Bradshaw said it before me, but I have to repeat. L</span><span>arge scale software development requires exposure to a lot of tooling and process beyond just writing code - version control, code reviews, bug tracking, code&nbsp;</span><span>maintenance</span><span>, release process, coordinating with collaborators. Contributing to an active open-source project with a large number of&nbsp;contributors like Sage, is a great way to experience all that and see if you would like to make it your profession. A lot of mathematicians write clever code for their research, but if less than 10 people see it and use it, it is not a&nbsp;</span><span>realistic</span><span>&nbsp;representation of what working as a software engineer feels like.&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span><br /></span></div><div><span>The software industry is in large demand of developers and hiring straight from&nbsp;</span><span>academia is very common</span><span>. B</span><span>efore I got hired by Google, the only software development experience on my resume</span><span>&nbsp;was the&nbsp;Sage graph editor. Along with solid understanding of algorithms and data structures that was enough to get in."</span></div></div><h3 id="robert-bradshaw-google-"><span>David Moulton (Google)</span></h3><div>“Google hires mathematicians now as quantitative analysts = data engineers. Google is very flexible for a tech company about the backgrounds of its employees. We have a long-standing reading group on category theory, and we’re about to start one on Babai’s recent quasi- polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism. And we have a math discussion group with lots of interesting math on it.”</div><h2 id="advice-for-departments">My advice for math professors</h2><div>Obviously, encourage your students to get involved in open source projects like Sage, even if it appears to be a waste of time or distraction from their thesis work (this will likely feel very counterintuitive you’ll hate it).</div><div>At Univ of Washington, a few years ago I taught a graduate-level course on Sage development. The department then refused to run it again as a grad course, which was frankly&nbsp;<span>very</span>&nbsp;frustrating to me. This is exactly the wrong thing to do if you want to increase the options of your Ph.D. students for industry jobs. Maybe quit trying to train our students to be only math professors, and instead give them a much wider range of options.</div></div>

<p><strong>Dealing with tikzpictures</strong></p>
<p>Since I create lots of tikzpictures in my code and also because I was unhappy
at how the <tt class="docutils literal">view</tt> command of Sage handles them (a tikzpicture is not a math
expression to put inside dollar signs), I decided to create a class for
tikzpictures. I think this module could be usefull in Sage so I will propose
its inclusion soon.</p>
<p>I am using the standalone document class which allows some configurations like
the border:</p>

<h4><a href="http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2015/11/writing-prime-numbers-and-riemann.html">"Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis", Cambridge University Press, and SageMathCloud</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>Barry Mazur and I spent over a decade writing a popular math book "Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis", which will be published by Cambridge Univeristy Press in 2016. &nbsp;The book involves a large number of illustrations created using <a href="http://sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>, and was mostly written using the LaTeX editor in <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a>.<br /><br />This post is meant to provide a glimpse into the writing process and also content of the book.<br /><br />This is about making research math a little more accessible, about math education, and about technology.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>Intended Audience:</strong> Research mathematicians! Though there is no mathematics at all in this post.<br /><br />The book is here: <a href="http://wstein.org/rh/">http://wstein.org/rh/</a><br />Download a copy before we have to remove it from the web!<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of our book is simply to explain what the Riemann Hypothesis is really about. It is a book about mathematics by two mathematicians. The mathematics is front and center; we barely touch on people, history, or culture, since there are already numerous books that address the non-mathematical aspects of RH. &nbsp;Our target audience is math-loving high school students, retired electrical engineers, and you.<br /><h2 id="clay-mathematics-institute-lectures-2005">Clay Mathematics Institute Lectures: 2005</h2>The book started in May 2005 when the Clay Math Institute asked Barry Mazur to give a large lecture to a popular audience at MIT and he chose to talk about RH, with me helping with preparations. His talk was entitled "Are there still unsolved problems about the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... ?"<br /><br />See <a href="http://www.claymath.org/library/public_lectures/mazur_riemann_hypothesis.pdf">http://www.claymath.org/library/public_lectures/mazur_riemann_hypothesis.pdf</a><br /><br />Barry Mazur receiving a prize:<br /><br /><div class="figure"><img src="http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Barry+C+Mazur+Obama+Honors+Winners+Nat+l+Medal+1QnaS-NICosl.jpg" height="213" width="320" /></div><br />Barry's talk went well, and we decided to try to expand on it in the form of a book. We had a long summer working session in a vacation house near an Atlantic beach, in which we greatly refined our presentation. (I remember that I also finally switched from Linux to OS X on my laptop when Ubuntu made a huge mistake pushing out a standard update that hosed X11 for everybody in the world.)<br /><h2 id="classical-fourier-transform">Classical Fourier Transform</h2>Going beyond the original Clay Lecture, I kept pushing Barry to see if he could describe RH as much as possible in terms of the classical Fourier transform applied to a function that could be derived via a very simple process from the prime counting function pi(x). Of course, he could. This led to more questions than it answered, and interesting numerical observations that are more precise than analytic number theorists typically consider.<br /><br />Our approach to writing the book was to try to reverse engineer how Riemann might have been inspired to come up with RH in the first place, given how Fourier analysis of periodic functions was in the air. This led us to some surprisingly subtle mathematical questions, some of which we plan to investigate in research papers. They also indirectly play a role in Simon Spicer's recent UW Ph.D. thesis. (The expert analytic number theorist Andrew Granville helped us out of many confusing thickets.)<br /><br />In order to use Fourier series we naturally have to rely heavily on Dirac/Schwartz distributions.<br /><h2 id="simuw">SIMUW</h2>University of Washington has a great program called <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~simuw/">SIMUW: "Summer Institute for Mathematics at Univ of Washington.''</a> It's for high school; admission is free and based on student merit, not rich parents, thanks to an anonymous wealthy donor! &nbsp;I taught a SIMUW course one summer from the RH book. &nbsp;I spent one very intense week on the RH book, and another on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.<br /><br />The first part of our book worked well for high school students. For example, we interactively worked with prime races, multiplicative parity, prime counting, etc., using Sage interacts. The students could also prove facts in number theory. They also looked at misleading data and tried to come up with conjectures. <em>In algebraic number theory, usually the first few examples are a pretty good indication of what is true. In analytic number theory, in contrast, looking at the first few million examples is usually deeply misleading.</em><br /><h2 id="reader-feedback-i-dare-you-to-find-a-typo">Reader feedback: "I dare you to find a typo!"</h2>In early 2015, we posted drafts on Google+ daring anybody to find typos. We got massive feedback. I couldn't believe the typos people found. One person would find a subtle issue with half of a bibliography reference in German, and somebody else would find a different subtle mistake in the same reference. Best of all, highly critical and careful non-mathematicians read straight through the book and found a large number of typos and minor issues that were just plain confusing to them, but could be easily clarified.<br /><br />Now the book is hopefully not riddled with errors. Thanks entirely to the amazingly generous feedback of these readers, when you flip to a random page of our book (go ahead and try), you are now unlikely to see a typo or, what's worse, some corrupted mathematics, e.g., a formula with an undefined symbol.<br /><h2 id="designing-the-cover">Designing the cover</h2>Barry and Gretchen Mazur, Will Hearst, and I designed a cover that combined the main elements of the book: title, Riemann, zeta:<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BlG3G0uRyME/Vk4iY4C_-hI/AAAAAAABWe4/9aWAhvetQcs/s1600/our-cover%2B%25281%2529.png"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BlG3G0uRyME/Vk4iY4C_-hI/AAAAAAABWe4/9aWAhvetQcs/s320/our-cover%2B%25281%2529.png" width="318" /></a></div><br /><br />Then designers at CUP made our rough design more attractive according their tastes. As non-mathematician designers, they made it look prettier by messing with the Riemann Zeta function...<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mpMWjFosfFE/Vk4icxOXdAI/AAAAAAABWfA/tKubeiVWZp8/s1600/bad-cover%2B%25281%2529.png"><img border="0" height="224" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mpMWjFosfFE/Vk4icxOXdAI/AAAAAAABWfA/tKubeiVWZp8/s320/bad-cover%2B%25281%2529.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><h2 id="publishing-with-cambridge-university-press">Publishing with Cambridge University Press</h2>Over years, we talked with people from AMS, Springer-Verlag and Princeton Univ Press about publishing our book. I met CUP editor Kaitlin Leach at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in Baltimore, since the Cambridge University Press (CUP) booth was directly opposite the SageMath booth, which I was running. We decided, due to their enthusiasm, which lasted more than for the few minutes while talking to them (!), past good experience, and general frustration with other publishers, to publish with CUP.<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-noEWAhfd_UA/Vk4ih_6bFJI/AAAAAAABWfI/TFqJyyy_stU/s1600/cup.png"><img border="0" height="67" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-noEWAhfd_UA/Vk4ih_6bFJI/AAAAAAABWfI/TFqJyyy_stU/s320/cup.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><h3 id="what-is-was-like-for-us-working-with-cup">What is was like for us working with CUP</h3>The actual process with CUP has had its ups and downs, and the production process has been frustrating at times, being in some ways not quite professional enough and in other ways extremely professional. Traditional book publication is currently in a state of rapid change. Working with CUP has been unlike my experiences with other publishers.<br /><br />For example, CUP was extremely diligent putting huge effort into tracking down permissions for every one of the images in our book. And they weren't satisfy with a statement on Wikipedia that "this image is public domain", if the link didn't work. They tracked down alternatives for all images for which they could get permissions (or in some cases have us partly pay for them). This is in sharp contrast to my experience with Springer-Verlag, which spent about one second on images, just making sure I signed a statement that all possible copyright infringement was my fault (not their's).<br /><br />The CUP copyediting and typesetting appeared to all be outsourced to India, organized by people who seemed far more comfortable with Word than LaTeX. Communication with people that were being contracted out about our book's copyediting was surprisingly difficult, a problem that I haven't experienced before with Springer and AMS. That said, everything seems to have worked out fine so far.<br /><br />On the other hand, our marketing contact at CUP mysteriously vanished for a long time; evidently, they had left to another job, and CUP was recruiting somebody else to take over. However, now there are new people and they seem extremely passionate!<br /><h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>I'm particularly excited to see if we can produce an electronic (Kindle) version of the book later in 2016, and eventually a fully interactive complete for-pay SageMathCloud version of the book, which could be a foundation for something much broader with publishers, which addresses the shortcoming of the Kindle format for interactive computational books. Things like electronic versions of books are the sort of things that AMS is frustratingly slow to get their heads around...<br /><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><ol><li>Publishing a high quality book is a long and involved process.</li><li>Working with CUP has been frustrating at times; however, they have recruited a very strong team this year that addresses most issues.</li><li>I hope mathematicians will put more effort into making mathematics accessible to non-mathematicians.</li><li>Hopefully, this talk will give provide a more glimpse into the book writing process and encourage others (and also suggest things to think about when choosing a publisher and before signing a book contract!)</li></ol></div>

<p>Let $M$ be a matroid with groundset $E$ and rank function $r$. A partition of the groundset $\{E_1,E_2\}$ is a $m$-separation if $|E_1|,|E_2|\geq m$ and $r(E_1)+r(E_2)-r(E)\leq m-1$. $M$ is called $k$-connected if there is no $m$-separation for any $m  k$. 

The Fano matroid is an example of $3$-connected matroid.


<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>The Fano matroid is not $4$-connected. Using the <code>certificate=True</code> field, we can also output a certificate that verify its not-$4$-connectness. The certificate is a $m$-separation where $m  4$. Since we know Fano matroid is $3$-connected, we know the output should be a $3$-separation.


<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>We also have a method for deciding $k$-connectivity, and returning a certificate. </p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>There are 3 algorithms for $3$-connectivity. One can pass it as a string to the <code>algorithm</code> field of <code>is_3connected</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>"bridges"</code>: The $3$-connectivity algorithm Bixby and Cunningham. [BC79] </li>
<li><code>"intersection"</code>: the matroid intersection based algorithm</li>
<li><code>"shifting"</code>: the shifting algorithm. [Raj87] </li></ol></p></p>

<p>The default algorithm is the bridges based algorithm.</p>
<p>The following is an example to compare the running time of each approach. </p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>The new bridges based algorithm is much faster than the previous algorithm in SAGE.</p>
<p>For $4$-connectivity, we tried to use the shifting approach, which has an running time of $O(n^{4.5}\sqrt{\log n})$, where $n$ is the size of the groundset. The intuitive idea is fixing some elements and tries to grow a separator. In theory, the shifting algorithm should be fast if the graph is not $4$-connected, as we can be lucky and find a separator quickly. In practice, it is still slower than the optimized matroid intersection based algorithm, which have a worst case $O(n^5)$ running time. There might be two reasons: the matroid intersection actually avoids the worst case running time in practice, and the shifting algorithm is not well optimized.</p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<h1>Matroid intersection and union</h1>
<p>There is a new implementation of matroid intersection algorithm based on Cunningham&#8217;s paper [Cun86].  For people who are familiar with blocking flow algorithms for maximum flows, this is the matroid version. The running time is $O(\sqrt{p}rn)$, where $p$ is the size of the maximum common independent set, $r$ is the rank, and $n$ is the size of the groundset. Here is an example of taking matroid intersection between two randomly generated linear matroids.</p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>Using matroid intersection, we have preliminary support for matroid union and matroid sum. Both construction takes a list of matroids.</p>
<p>The matroid sum operation takes disjoint union of the groundsets. Hence the new ground set will have the first coordinate indicating which matroid it comes from, and second coordinate indicate the element in the matroid. </p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>Here is an example of matroid union of two copies of uniform matroid $U(1,5)$ and $U(2,5)$. The output is isomorphic to $U(4,5)$.</p>
<div class="sage1"></div>
<p>One of the application of matroid union is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid_partitioning">matroid partitioning</a>, which partitions the groundset of the matroid to minimum number of independent sets. Here is an example that partitions the edges of a graph to minimum number of forests. </p>

<h4><a href="http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2015/09/what-is-sagemaths-strategy.html">What is SageMath's strategy?</a></h4>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Here is <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>'s strategy, or at least what my strategy toward SageMath has been for the last 5 years.<br /><h1 id="diagnose-the-problem">Diagnose the problem</h1><strong>Statement of problem:</strong> SageMath is not growing.<br /><h3 id="justification">Justification</h3>Facts: Growth in the number of active users [1] of SageMath has stalled since about 2011 (as defined by Google analytics on sagemath.org). From 2008 to 2011, year-on-year growth was about 50%, which isn't great. However, from 2011 to now, year-on-year growth is slightly less than 0%. It was maybe -10% from 2013 to 2014. Incidentally, number of monthly active users of sagemath.org is about 68,652 right now, but the raw number isn't as import as the year-to-year rate of change.<br /><br />I set an overall mission statement for the Sage project at the outset, which was is to be a viable alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab. Being a "viable alternative" is something that holds or doesn't for specific people. A useful measure of this mission then is whether or not people use Sage. This is a different metric than trying to argue from "first principles" by making a list of features of each system, comparing benchmarks, etc.<br /><br /><div class="separator"></div><div class="separator"><br /></div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WXt0yL0eZn0/Vgy7ICAimcI/AAAAAAABWGs/MmOurNhORYg/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B11.00.28%2BAM.png"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WXt0yL0eZn0/Vgy7ICAimcI/AAAAAAABWGs/MmOurNhORYg/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B11.00.28%2BAM.png" width="400" /></a><br /><div class="separator"><br /></div><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-shXxtJeO9fY/Vgy7IMVWIcI/AAAAAAABWGo/nLJu-40-9Ns/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B10.59.32%2BAM.png"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-shXxtJeO9fY/Vgy7IMVWIcI/AAAAAAABWGo/nLJu-40-9Ns/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B10.59.32%2BAM.png" width="400" /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WXt0yL0eZn0/Vgy7ICAimcI/AAAAAAABWGs/MmOurNhORYg/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B11.00.28%2BAM.png"><br /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WXt0yL0eZn0/Vgy7ICAimcI/AAAAAAABWGs/MmOurNhORYg/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B11.00.28%2BAM.png"><br /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WXt0yL0eZn0/Vgy7ICAimcI/AAAAAAABWGs/MmOurNhORYg/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-30%2Bat%2B11.00.28%2BAM.png"><br /></a><br /><div class="separator"><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><h1 id="guiding-policies">Guiding policies</h1><strong>Statement of policy:</strong> focus on undergraduate students in STEM courses (science, tech, engineering, math)<br /><h3 id="justification-1">Justification</h3>In order for Sage to start growing again, identify groups of people that are not using Sage. Then decide, for each of these groups, who might find value in using Sage, especially if we are able to put work into making it easier for them to benefit from Sage. This is something to re-evaluate periodically. In itself, this is very generic -- it's what any software project that wishes to grow should do. The interesting part is the details.<br />Some big groups of potential future users of Sage, who use Sage very little now, include<br /><ul><li>employees/engineers in various industries (from defense contractors, to finance, to health care to "data science").</li><li>researchers in area of mathematics where Sage is currently not popular</li><li>undergraduate students in STEM courses (science, tech, engineering, math)</li></ul>I think by far the most promising group is "undergraduate students in STEM courses". In many cases they use no software at all or are unhappy with what they do use. They are extremely cost sensitive. Open source provides a unique advantage in education because it is less expensive than closed source software, and having access to source code is something that instructors consider valuable as part of the learning experience. Also, state of the art performance, which often requires enormous dedicated for-pay work, is frequently not a requirement.<br /><h1 id="actions">Actions</h1><ul><li>(a) Make access to Sage as easy as possible.</li><li>(b) Encourage the creation of educational resources (books, tutorials, etc.) that make using Sage for particular courses as easy as possible.</li><li>(c) Implement missing functionality in Sage that is needed in support of undergraduate teaching.</li></ul><br /><h3 id="justification-2">Justification</h3>Why don't more undergraduates use Sage? For the most part, students use what they are told to use by their instructors. So why don't instructors chose to use Sage? (a) Sage is not trivial to install (in fact it is incredibly hard to install), (b) There are limited resources (books, tutorials, course materials, etc.) for making using Sage really easy, (c) Sage is missing key functionality needed in support undergraduate teaching.<br /><br />Regarding (c), in 2008 Sage was utterly useless for most STEM courses. However, over the years things changed for the better, due to the hard work of Rob Beezer, Karl Dieter, Burcin Erocal, and many others. Also, for quite a bit of STEM work, the numerical Python ecosystem (and/or R) provides much of what is needed, and both have evolved enormously in recent years. They are all usable from Sage, and making such use <em>easier</em> should be an extremely high priority. Related -- Bill Hart wrote "I recently sat down with some serious developers and we discussed symbolics in Sage (which I know nothing about). They argued that Sage is not a viable contender in that area, and we discussed some of the possible reasons for that. " The reason is that the symbolic functionality in Sage is motivated by making Sage useful for undergraduate teaching; it has nothing to do with what serious developers in symbolics would care about.<br /><br />Regarding (b), an NSF (called "<a href="http://utmost.aimath.org/">UTMOST</a>") helped in this direction... Also, Gregory Bard wrote <a href="http://www.gregorybard.com/SAGE.html">"Sage for undergraduates"</a>, which is <em>exactly</em> the sort of thing we should be very strongly encouraging. This is a book that is published by the AMS and is also freely available. And it squarely addresses exactly this audience. Similarly, <a href="http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/">the French book that Paul Zimmerman edited</a> is fantastic for France. Let's make an order of magnitude similar resources along these lines! Let's make vastly more tutorials and reference manuals that are "for undergraduates".<br /><br />Regarding (a), in my opinion the most viable option that fits with current trends in software is a full web application that provides access to Sage. <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud </a>is what I've been doing in this direction, and it's been growing since 2013 at over 100% year on year, and much is in place so that it could scale up to more users. It still has a huge way to go regarding user friendliness, and it is still <em>losing money every month</em>. But it is a concrete action toward which nontrivial effort has been invested, and it has the potential to solve problem (a) for a large number of potential STEM users. College students very often have extremely good bandwidth coupled with cheap weak laptops, so a web application is the natural solution for them.<br /><br />Though much has been done to make Sage easier to install on individual computers, it's exactly the sort of problem that money could help solve, but for which we have little money. I'm optimistic that <a href="http://opendreamkit.org/">OpenDreamKit</a> will do something in this direction.<br /><br />[I've made this post motivated by the<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/enoyWPdYK_g"> discussion in this thread.</a>&nbsp; Also, I used the framework from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239">this book</a>.]</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div class="document">
<p>Some years ago, I wrote <a class="reference external" href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/games/sage/games/quantumino.html">code</a> in Sage to solve the Quantumino puzzle. I also
used it to make a one-minute <a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/35348052">video</a> illustrating the Dancing links algorithm
which I am proud to say it is now part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Links">Dancing links</a> wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Let me recall that the goal of the Quantumino puzzle is to fill a \(2\times
5\times 8\) box with 16 out of 17 three-dimensional pentaminos. After writing
the sage code to solve the puzzle, one question was left: how many solutions
are there? Is the <a class="reference external" href="http://familygamesamerica.com/mainsite/consumers/productview.php?pro_id=274">official website</a> realist or very prudent when they say
that <em>there are over 10.000 potential solutions</em>? Can it be computed in hours?
days? months? years? The only thing I knew was that the following computation
(letting the 0-th pentamino aside) never finished on my machine:</p>


<div class="pygments_manni"><pre><span class="n">sage</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sage.games.quantumino</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">QuantuminoSolver</span>

</pre></div>



<p>Since I spent already too much time on this side-project, I decided in 2012 to
stop investing any more time on it and to really focus on finishing writing my
thesis.</p>
<p>So before I finish writing my thesis, I knew that the computation was not going
to take a light-year, since I was able to finish the computation of the number
of solutions when the 0-th pentamino is put aside and when one pentamino is
pre-positioned somewhere in the box. That computation completed in 4 hours on
my old laptop and gave about 5 millions solutions. There are 17 choices of
pentatminos to put aside, there are 360 distinct positions of that pentamino in
the box, so I estimated the number of solution to be something like
\(17\times 360\times 5000000 = 30 \times 10^9\). Most importantly, I
estimated the computation to take \(17\times 360\times 4= 24480\) hours or
1020 days. Therefore, I knew I could not do it on my laptop.</p>
<p>But last year, I received an email from the designer of the Quantumino puzzle:</p>

hi sébastien labbé,

i'm the designer of the quantumino puzzle.
i'm not a mathematician, i'm an architect. i like mathematics.
i'm quite impressed to see the sage work on quantumino, also i have not the
knowledge for full understanding.

i have a question for you - can you tell me HOW MANY different quantumino-
solutions exist?

ty and bye

<p>This summer was a good timing to launch the computation on my beautiful Intel®
Core™ i5-4590 CPU &#64; 3.30GHz × 4 at Université de Liège. First, I improved the
Sage code to allow a parallel computation of number of solutions in the dancing
links code (<a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18987">#18987</a>, merged in a Sage 6.9.beta6). Secondly, we may remark
that each tiling of the \(2\times 5\times 8\) box can be rotated in order
to find 3 other solutions. It is possible to gain a factor 4 by avoiding to
count 4 times the same solution up to rotations (<a class="reference external" href="http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19107">#19107</a>, still needs work
from myself). Thanks to Vincent Delecroix for doing the review on both ticket.
Dividing the estimated 1024 days of computation needed by a factor \(4\times
4=16\) gives an approximation of 64 days to complete the computation. Two
months, just enough to be tractable!</p>
<p>With those two tickets (some previous version to be honest) on top of sage-6.8,
I started the computation on August 4th and the computation finished last week
on September 18th for a total of 45 days. The computation was stopped only once
on September 8th (I forgot to close firefox and thunderbird that night...).</p>
<p>The number of solutions and computation time for each pentamino put aside
together with the first solution found is shown in the table below.  We remark
that some values are equal when the aside pentaminoes are miror images
(why!?:).</p>

<p><strong>About the video on wikipedia.</strong></p>
<p>I must say that the video is not perfect. On wikipedia, the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Dancing_links_Quantumino_puzzle.ogv">file talk page</a>
of the video says that the <em>Jerky camera movement is distracting</em>. That is
because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slabbe.org/blogue/2012/01/faire-une-animation-en-3d-avec-sage/">I managed to make the video</a> out of images created by
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.show(viewer='tachyon')</span></tt> which changes the coordinate system, hardcodes a
lot of parameters, zoom properly, simplifies stuff to make sure the user don't
see just a blank image. But, for making a movie, we need access to more
parameters especially the placement of the camera (to avoid the jerky
movement). I know that Tachyon allows all of that. It is still a project that I
have to create a more versatile <tt class="docutils literal">Graphics3D <span class="pre">-&gt;</span> Tachyon</tt> conversion allowing
to construct nice videos of evolving mathematical objects. That's another
story.</p>

<h1 id="funding-open-source-mathematical-software-in-the-united-states">Funding Open Source Mathematical Software in the United States</h1>I do <em><strong>not</strong></em> know how to get funding for open source mathematical software in the United States. However, I'm trying.<br /><h2 id="why-because-sage-is-hobbling-along">Why: Because Sage is Hobbling Along</h2>Despite what we might think in our Sage-developer bubble, <a href="http://sagemath.org/">Sage</a> is hobbling along, and without an infusion of financial support very soon, I think the project is going to fail in the next few years. I have access to Google analytics data for <a href="http://sagemath.org/">sagemath.org</a> since 2007, and there has been no growth &nbsp;in active users of the website since 2011:<br /><br /><div class="separator"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zaHSSBsEAfU/VfI-Q55ar6I/AAAAAAABV-k/STtsAScT1YM/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-10%2Bat%2B7.28.14%2BPM.png"><img border="0" height="187" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zaHSSBsEAfU/VfI-Q55ar6I/AAAAAAABV-k/STtsAScT1YM/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-09-10%2Bat%2B7.28.14%2BPM.png" width="400" /></a></div><h2 id="something-that-is-missing">Something that is Missing</h2>The worse part of all for me, after ten years, is seeing things like <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/cAFdRb-WKqM">this email</a> today from John Palmieri, where he talks about writing <em>slow</em> but interesting algebraic topology code, and needing help from somebody who knows Cython to actually make his code fast.<br /><br />I know from my three visits to the Magma group in Sydney that such assistance is <em>precisely</em> what having real financial support can provide. Such money makes it possible to have fulltime people who know the tools and how to optimize them well, and they work on this sort of speedup and integration -- this "devil is in the details" work -- for each major contribution (they are sort of like a highly skilled version of a journal copy editor and referee all in one). Doing this makes a massive difference, but also costs on the order of $1 million / year to have any real impact. 1 million is probably the Magma budget to support around 10 people and periodic visitors, and of course like 1% of the budget of Matlab/Mathematica. Magma has this support partly because Magma is closed source, and maintains tight control on who may use it.<br /><h2 id="searching-for-a-funding-model">Searching for a Funding Model</h2>Sage is open source and freely available to all, so it is of potential huge value to the community by being owned by everybody and changeable. However, those who fund Magma (either directly or indirectly) haven't funded Sage at the same level for some reason. I can't make Sage closed source and copy that very successful funding model. I've tried everything I can think of given the time and resources I have, and the only model left that seems able to support open source is having a company that does <strong>something else</strong> well and makes money, then using some of the profit to fund open source (<a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/intel-overtakes-red-hat-to-become-top-linux-kernel-contributor">Intel is the biggest contributor to Linux</a>).<br /><h2 id="sagemathcloud">SageMath, Inc.</h2>Since I failed to find any companies that passionately care about Sage like Intel/Google/RedHat/etc. care about Linux, I started one. I've been working on <a href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/">SageMathCloud</a> extremely hard for over 3 years now, with the hopes that at least it could be a way to fund Sage development.</div>
